# OmoroINE
  
TURNKHackathon's project (in Osaka 2018)  
  
## Overview
It is more fun at the station in the Kansai area.  
  
Share interesting information on riding stations with the LINE Message API.  
  
Send the position information from LINE and select the station.  
  
You can also select from the IC card "ride / get" station information.  
  
Feedback the interestingness to the interesting information taught for me.  
  
We will provide "laugh" to people using stations in the Kansai area.
